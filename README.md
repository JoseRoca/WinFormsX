# WinFormsX

## Windows Form library for FreeBASIC

WinFormsX is a forms building library for the FreeBASIC programming language. It is designed specifically for the Windows operating system. The goal of WinFormsX is to hide the complexity of the Win32 API that powers Windows application development. This is done through easy to use classes and syntax that is similar in nature to that of higher level programming languages like vb.net and C#.

WinFormsX is the library that the WinFBE Editor uses to generate code for its built-in Visual Designer. WinFormsX comes preinstalled with the WinFBE Editor.

- WinFBE Editor. Full featured, open source, Windows based, code editor. This editor integrates perfectly with the FreeBASIC compiler that you would have installed in the previous step. Download from [https://github.com/PaulSquires/WinFBE/releases](https://github.com/PaulSquires/WinFBE/releases). There is no formal installation program required. Simply unzip the downloaded file to any folder on your computer and then run either the WinFBE32.exe or WinFBE64.exe program depending on your version of Windows.
